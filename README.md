# hex-py

The [game Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) is a connection game played on a [hexagonal grid](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/). This version is implemented in [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Goals

* Minimalistic UI with 2 player hot seat support
* Ideally could configure board size and number of players
* Able to serialize game state to file, and load from file as well
* Step through turn history
* Simple AI agents
